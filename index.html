        <p> My grandfather, Late Shri. Gopi Ram Gupta always encouraged creative thought and supported us throughout our
            creative education. He knew that the Indian society did not necessarily support such creative ambitions and
            he
            always strived for a multidisciplinary thinking. He <a href="http://rohitg.in/2021/04/20/Dadaji/">passed
                away</a>
                due to complications from CoVID . In his memory and spirit, I wish to propose this grant to support
            independent creatives from India. The aim is to support students, makers, artists, designers, and other
            creatives with expenditure in their projects and practice. <br><br>
